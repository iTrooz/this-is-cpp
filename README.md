- `and` keyword: (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_alternative) 
- Function declaration: C++11 (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/function 2) 
- module system: C++20 (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/modules). They are not quite working yet (the standard library modules seems to not be distributed in most distributions yet ?), so I had to create a build script to compiled the required headers into modules.
